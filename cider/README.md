*Overview
Using WTS/WGS or targeted data, we determine a comprehensive list of CDR3 sequences for each of the IG and TCR loci including an abundance estimate. 

The intended purposes of this are the following: 
- For B cell & T cell tumors, the IG / TCR loci can be used as a proxy for the number of clones in the tumor. The CDR3 sequence can also be used for MRD detection.  
- For other tumors, the abundance estimate can be used to estimate immune infiltration and may give insight into diversity, and/or recurrent and cancer specific T-cell clones. 
- We may be able to use epitope-TCR binding prediction tools (such as TCRex, NetTCR, Repitope) to predict binding of specific sequences 
- With very deep targeted sequencing we could determine the full IG/TCR receptor repertoire (eg. TCR beta diversity is estimated at 1-3M distinct sequences per individual). Diversity and evenness are also proposed as important characteristics
