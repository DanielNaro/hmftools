Signature Bucket Analyser - Method and Routines
===============================================

CONFIG AND PARAMETERS

Key constants (could become config):
- data prep
	- elevated probability - currently 1e-12
    - PERMITTED_PROB_NOISE  1e-4
	- MAX_NOISE_TO_SAMPLE_RATIO = 5; // per sample, the total potential noise across all buckets cannot exceeds this multiple of variant total
	- MAX_NOISE_ALLOC_PERC = 0.5; // per sample, the max vs total variants which can be allocated to noise
	- MutationalLoadCap (config):
		- SNVs: 10K
		- INDELs: 1500
		- MNVs: reassess

- discovery
	- min sample-pair bucket overlap for discovery of BGs - config, default = 3
    - min sample count percent = 0.0001 -  % of cohort to consider a pair of samples similar (5K at 0.01% of 55M)
    - MAX_CANDIDATE_GROUPS = 1500; // in place for speed and memory considerations
    - sample counts CSS threshold (config) = 0.995
    - run count or until negligible
    - excess unalloc method (config) - kicks in at Nth run

- fit and allocation
    - SKIP_ALLOC_FACTOR = 2.0; // skip adding a sample to a group if another candidate not chosen to allocate X times as much
    - MIN_GROUP_ALLOC_PERCENT = 0.10; // only allocate a sample to a group if it takes at this much of the elevated count
    - MIN_GROUP_ALLOC_PERCENT_LOWER = 0.03; // hard lower limit
	- min sample count for allocation:
		- SNVs: 400
		- INDELs: 80
		- MNVs: 4


Input Data
- sample counts matrix
- sample external data - cancer type and any other known attributes of the sample (eg Smoking, UV, MSI)
- config as above


ROUTINE STEPS and LOGIC

Step 1: Calc Preparation

Step 1: Sample Count Splits, Probabilities and Background Allocations

Step 1A: Median Background Sig Ratios
- within each cancer type, find all samples <= MutationalLoadCap
- if less than X or Y% are found, abort
- take their sample counts as implied bucket ratios (vs their sample total)
- average these out - this defines the background signature per cancer type

Step 1B: Allocate sample BG sig counts
- background allocations are optionally cached in a file and reloaded in each run to save recalc
- take min of sample count or MutationLoadCap
- use BG sig's bucket ratios to assign an initial expected count for each bucket to this BG sig
- use fit with Poisson noise to allocate to BG signature
	- checks each attempted fit using log-likelihood and input Poisson prob of 99%
	- check this all again??
- output is a sample allocation to the BG sig
	- which should fit that amount within the bounds of noise for each sample
	- can this instead just be swapped out for the standard fit routine? that's what's done anyway
- cache result in a file

Step 1C: Splitting counts and probabilities
- set BG count and elevated count (being actual count - background)
- calc Poisson probability, adjusted for FDR (samples * buckets)
- background counts used for probabilities but then folded in with elevated counts for all subsequent discovery and group allocation

Step 1D: Calc noise
- using Poisson prob to calc noise range for each sample bucket count
- limit noise total per sample to 5x sample count (affects the lower mut load sample)


Repeated Routine
- repeat Steps 2 & 3 until:
	- no candiate groups potential allocation exceeds 0.001 of cohort size (or no new candidate groups found)
- proceed to final fit in Step 4
- log final analyses


Step 2: Candidate Group Discovery

Step 2A: Find Candidate Groups from sample pair subset buckets
- start with overlapping elevated buckets for a pair of samoples
- if the unallocated counts in these buckets have CSS > threshold (eg 0.995), form a group
- if not, remove the worst bucket and continue down to min of 3 overlapping buckets
- constraints:
	- CSS > 0.995
	- sample count >= min sample count percent (eg 0.0001 * cohort total, eg 55M)
	- each of the 2 samples' potential allocation >= 10% (GroupAllocMinPerc)

Step 2B: Candidate Groups from excess unalloc counts:
- take each sample pairs' unalloc buckets (ie the ids)
- if overlap >= 80%, form a group
- constraints:
	- min bucket overlap (eg 2 or 3) 
	- sample count >= min sample count percent (eg 0.0001 * cohort total, eg 55M)
	- each of the 2 samples' potential allocation >= 10% (GroupAllocMinPerc)


Step 3: Candidate Group Selection

Step 3A: Rank Candidate Groups
- take each proposed candidate group
- test fit for every sample against every group (ie reshuffling existing group allocs)
- add a sample as a potential allocation if:
	- >= GroupAllocMinPerc (eg 10%)
	- would not be allocated X times that to another group (SkipAllocFactor, currently 2)
- calculate a total potential alloc per candidate group, weighted by sample alloc percent
	- eg if a sample would allocate 10K variants to a group, and this would then be a 80% alloc for that sample, 
	- then potential adjusted alloc = 8K
- take the group with the highest potential adjusted allocation

Step 3B: Top Group Refinement
- merge in the samples from any other candidate group with CSS from ratios > CSS threshold
- add as candidates any additional buckets from these merged groups
- run SigOptimiser routine to refine the bucket group ratios and to test out adding candidate buckets
	- tests each bucket ratio independently for optimal value
	- must increase the overall allocation for samples in the group
	- candidate buckets must additionally have sample ratios between 10 and 90th percentiles fall within X% range (currently 20%)

Step 3C: Top Group Sample Allocation
- allocate any sample if alloc counts exceeds MinAllocGroup threshold
- at the same time run the SigContrib optimsation to reshuffle sig allocs
- this can cause a sample to change the groups it is currently allocated to

Step 3D: Check skipped samples
- after each run of new group allocation, check the set of skipped samples from previous runs
- any sample not allocated and not skipped again, can now be allocated if other criteria is met (ie above MinGroupAlloc threshold)


Step 4: Final Sample Fit Allocation
- clear all existing allocations
- run an optimal fit routine on each sample with:
	- its relevant background sig (by cancer type)
	- any other bucket group with potential alloc >= MinGroupAllocPercLower (eg 3%)
- apply all the optimally-fitted group allocs


Step 5: Analysis of Results
- search external sample data for dominant cancer types and other features & effects
- find worst samples and buckets
- compare sigs, look for sig-reconstruction and corrections and similar sig-contributions
- compare proposed sigs to PCAWG
- write out various data sets for post-run R analysis and presentation
