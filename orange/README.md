# Oncogenic Results of Analyzing the Genome

(readme is in progress!)

ORANGE summarizes the key outputs from all algo's in the Hartwig suite into a single PDF. 
An example report based on the publicly available melanoma cell line COLO829 can be found [here](src/main/resources/Test.orange.pdf).

In addition to the front page giving all high-level stats about the sample, the following chapters are generated in the ORANGE report:
 
  - [Clinical Evidence](#clinical-evidence): What genomic evidence has been found in favor of, or against, specific treatments?
  - [Somatic Findings](#somatic-findings): What potentially relevant mutations have been found in the tumor specifically?
  - [Germline Findings](#germline-findings): What potentially relevant mutations have been found in the germline DNA? 
  - [Immunology](#immunology): What can we tell about the immunogenicity of the tumor sample?
  - [Cohort Comparison](#cohort-comparison): How does the various properties of this tumor compare to existing cancer cohorts?
  - [Quality Control](#quality-control): Various stats and graphs regarding the quality of the data and interpretation thereof.
