Run the following commands as root (admin) on mysql prior to building

mysql> CREATE USER 'build'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'build';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> CREATE DATABASE hmfpatients;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL on hmfpatients.* TO 'build'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

Then make sure hmfpatients is filled by running 'generate_database.sql'

CREATE USER 'build'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'build';
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS hmfpatients;
CREATE DATABASE hmfpatients;
GRANT ALL on hmfpatients.* TO 'build'@'localhost';
USE hmfpatients;
